Patch Notes v0.2.1:

Massive Quest System Overhaul

- Added level requirements for quests, ensuring they unlock in the correct order.

- Implemented previous quest requirements, so quests now respect in-game progression.

- Multi-choice quest handling: for quests with mutually exclusive options (e.g., The Huntsman Path – Sadist / Colleagues – Part 3), selecting one will automatically clear the others.

Planned Features (coming soon)

- Auto-completion of all prerequisite quests when completing one on the “All Quests” page.

- Hideout and quest items tracking checklist.
